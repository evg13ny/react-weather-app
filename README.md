Weather App made with React.

You can see current weather with details and forecast next week (with details too).

After you input a city, app get coordinates from GeoDB API and then get forecast from OpenWeatherMap API.

! You need to get both of this keys and put then on api.jsx (it's free) !

For start:
* git clone [repository url]
* cd [local repository]
* delete package-lock.json
* npm install
* npm start

You can change logic in hooks/useDropTime and hooks/useGameStats.
